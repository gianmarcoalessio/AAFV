You are an advanced question generator that take a question and creates variations of QUESTION while maintaining their structure and intent. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the key components of the input question, such as variables, numbers, functions, or specific descriptions.
2. Replace these key components with plausible alternative values, ensuring the overall structure, tone, and intent of the question remain the same.
3. Ensure no repeated inputs are generated across examples, providing unique variations for each prompt.
4. DO NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION. Focus on creating one and plausible variation of the input question. DO NOT include any additional text in your response. JUST INCLUDE THE OUTPUT QUESTION, NOT INCLUDE ANY STARTING TEXT.

Imagine you are a drone operator. You are currently operating a drone that is at a point (5, 7) in the sky. You are asked to move the drone to a new point (10, 15). After reaching the new point, you are again asked to move the drone to another point (20, 25). Can you calculate the total distance the drone has traveled using the Euclidean norm method?

Imagine you are a robot operator. You are controlling a robot that starts at the position (2, 3) in a 2D plane. You are instructed to move the robot to a new position (8, 12). After arriving at this position, you are tasked with moving the robot to another point (15, 20). Can you calculate the total distance the robot has traveled using the Euclidean distance method?

In a game of basketball, a player has a 60% chance of making a successful shot. In a particular match, the player attempts 10 shots. What is the probability that the player makes exactly 6 successful shots? Now, consider a different scenario where the player's success rate drops to 50% but the number of attempts remains the same. What is the probability of making exactly 6 successful shots in this scenario? Finally, consider a third scenario where the player's success rate remains at 50% but the number of attempts increases to 15. What is the probability of making exactly 6 successful shots in this third scenario?

In a game of soccer, a player has a 70% chance of scoring a goal on a penalty kick. During a match, the player takes 5 penalty kicks. What is the probability of scoring exactly 3 goals? Now, consider a scenario where the player's success rate drops to 60% but the number of penalty kicks remains the same. What is the probability of scoring exactly 3 goals in this case? Lastly, imagine the player's success rate remains at 60% but the number of penalty kicks increases to 8. What is the probability of scoring exactly 3 goals in this scenario?

A chemist is conducting an experiment with a 2 kg sample of a specific substance A. The experiment begins with the substance at an initial temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. The chemist then heats the substance to a final temperature of 75 degrees Celsius. The experiment is conducted under a pressure of 1 atmosphere. The chemist repeats the experiment with the same substance, but this time the initial temperature is 10 degrees Celsius and the final temperature is 50 degrees Celsius. Can you calculate the change in entropy for the substance under these set initial and final conditions for both experiments?

A physicist is studying a 1.5 kg sample of a specific gas under a pressure of 2 atmospheres. The gas starts at an initial temperature of 30 degrees Celsius and is heated to a final temperature of 80 degrees Celsius. In a second experiment, the physicist uses the same gas sample but starts at 15 degrees Celsius and heats it to 60 degrees Celsius. Can you calculate the change in entropy for the gas in both experiments under the given conditions?
